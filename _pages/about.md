<br />
　　I am a Ph.D. candidate with the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology. I also received my bachelor degree in the School of Automation Science and Engineering from the same university in 2018. My research interests include multimedia understanding and embodied AI. 
<!-- I served as the reviewer for several top-tier journals and conferences, such as TIP, TNNLS, NeurIPS, AAAI, UAI, MICCAI. -->
